# About

I am Danny De Novi, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Messina and currently a data science master degree student. My current areas of interest are Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. My undergraduate thesis focused on studying the behavior of three reinforcement learning agents in the context of autonomous driving, which holds great promise for the future of transportation and safety. As we navigate the ever-evolving field of computer science, I'm dedicated to exploring and innovating in these domains to make the world a safer and more efficient place. 

Additionally, I have valuable experience as a Product Manager and Full Stack Developer at MIFRA Srl, where I utilized technologies like PHP (Laravel Framework), and JavaScript for web development and Swift with SwiftUI framework for iOS apps development. I was responsible for Docker and Kubernetes deployments and conducted regular maintenance on Linux Fedora servers.
Feel free to connect with me on Instagram or GitHub to join me on this exciting journey of exploration and innovation.
